i use xampp for the server

how to use it:
1. turn on apache and mySQL on XAMPP
2. import sql file to phpmyadmin
3. copy this project file to xampp>htdocs
4. open you browser and open localhost
5. and open the project

NOTE:
if you localhost run to XAMPP page it's because there's index inside htdocs you can just delete it or change it's name
or you can just localhost/projectname on you browser

for add and update bot command on you search bar after "chatbot" type "/admin" and it will to place where you can edit delete and add the bot command
